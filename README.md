## Hello, I’m [Abhijit More](https://abhijitmore.github.io/about/) 👋  

I’m a **Machine Learning & AI Engineer at F-Secure**, building **production-grade AI systems to protect users from scams and digital threats at scale**.

My work sits at the intersection of **deep learning, multimodal intelligence, and real-world system constraints** — where models must be **accurate, fast, robust, and deployable**, not just state-of-the-art on paper.

---

### 🛡️ What I Do
- 🔍 Design and deploy **AI systems that detect and prevent scams** across text, images, and user interaction signals  
- ⚙️ Build **end-to-end ML pipelines** — from data → model → inference → monitoring  
- 🚀 Focus on **low-latency, high-reliability** AI under real-world constraints  
- 🧠 Apply **NLP, Computer Vision, and multimodal learning** to user safety problems  
- 📦 Production-first mindset: testing, observability, scalability, and maintainability

---

### 🔬 Technical Interests
- **Scam & Abuse Detection**
- **Multimodal Learning (Text + Vision)**
- **Deep Learning Systems**
- **Model Optimization & Inference Efficiency**
- **LLMs in Production**
- **AI for Trust, Safety, and Security**

### 📌 Engineering Philosophy
> **Real-world AI is not about the model alone.**  
> It’s about data quality, system design, latency budgets, failure modes, and long-term maintainability.

I care deeply about:
- Clear problem formulation  
- Strong baselines  
- Measurable impact  
- Production-readiness over demos
